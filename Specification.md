# Specification of the project

My project is an extention of an existing game I created. The game is made in Unity, using C# and tools in the Unity game engine. The only external tool I used is Astar Pathfinding project for pathfinding https://arongranberg.com/astar/.

## The already existing game

### The even older game jam Moldus
Moldus was an idea created during the Matfyz Summer Game Jam. The game was quite broken and did not feature procedural generation. I did half of the programming on the game, mainly everything that did not feature enemy AI and pathfinding. I decided to make a new version of the game due to the fact that the idea and assets already exist, so I don't have to create new ones because I can't draw. I would like to give my thanks to Jaromir Prochazka for letting me use his sprites and for creating three new ones.

### Current Game
The game is a Dungeon Crawler where you need to search a procedurally generated level for the exit. The level is filled with enemies of three types, and you must defeat them using either your starting flamethrower or by switching infections. This can be achieved by killing enough enemies of a certain type and then pressing one of the 1, 2, 3 keys that are associated with the enemy type.

## What will be added upon and what the new project consists of

### Upgrading old features and polishing
I am planning to add much more Dot tween functions and add some much needed polish to the experience. I also want to change certain enemies and their attacks such as the red mushrooms bomb placing. Also considering to change the health system to a heart one.

### Adding rogue lite elements
By that there will be a system that lets the player unlock progress even though they lose a session. The system will work by collecting upgrade points by either defeating bosses, or by finding it in chests. 

#### Skill tree
I will be adding a skill tree. It will open up by clicking a button by canvas. In it you can use your upgrade points to upgrade the player. When the player dies, all of the progress will be lost, but the skill tree will remain, so the character improves each game. Some of the skills will be simple stat increases, but others add some special abilities or change existing ones.
##### Ability 1
##### Ability 2
##### Ability 3
##### Ability 4
### Bosses
I want to add at least three boss types, after their defeat they would drop an upgrade point. Three because of the three enemy types, each being an expasion of the original.
#### First
#### Second
#### Third

#### Changing the procedural generation
Ofcourse it will be change in respect to things that are mentioned above, but also I would like to add pillars to rooms. That could get destroyed
